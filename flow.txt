Hackathon ec2 instance w/ paper minecraft server makes /createbuild <prompt> which
gives u a building stick (stick w/ echantment custom). when u tap it a chat pops up asking what you want to build there, how big (small 256 x 256 x 256 medium 512 x 512 and large  2048 x 2048)
it calls a lambda that uses the hackathon_textToImage lambda and then uses that output as input for this hunyuan 3d sage maker piplein to create 3d textured glb. this glb should
be voxelized and then the voxels translted to a minecraft setblock commands (chunk it to avoid errors) on the coornidate (anchor it center center bottom ) from where the magic tapped. 

look at hackathon ec2 instance user data and teh s3 bucket wiht config and mods and add stuff there as wlel
